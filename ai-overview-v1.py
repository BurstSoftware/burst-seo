Welcome! This tool helps you understand the criteria Google considers for its AI Overviews (formerly Search Generative Experience or SGE).
AI Overviews provide quick, summarized answers at the top of search results for certain queries.
While Google hasn't released an exhaustive official list, this guide is based on their announcements, observed behavior, and stated goals.
